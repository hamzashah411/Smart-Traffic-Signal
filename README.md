# Smart-Traffic-Signal

As the human population grow ,the cities physical infrastructure is also expanding samultaniously .We build new roads connecting cities and homes on natural habitats.These locations contain rich wildlife ,and if not taken care of would decrease their populations inturn destroying the natural habitats.Each years their are thousands of accidents at traffic intersactions involving animals crossing when the lights are green.We as humans have a collective responsibility to keep them safe and secure while building new infrastructures.

I propose a solution that would help preventing such accidents by cautioning humans. Most of  the intersections already have installed cctv cameras for regulation purposes.We can use its feed and pass it to a machiene learning model to tell us weather there is an animal or not at the intersection it is filming.If yes we can then command the all traffic lights to turn red until the the animal has crossed the road.Moreover I have added a feature of live whatsapp status alert of that particular intersaction. We can also take a photo and send it to the whatsapp as proof.
